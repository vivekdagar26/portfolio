  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Vivek Dagar, a seasoned Microsoft Dynamics AX/D365 F&O developer with over 6 years of hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying enterprise ERP solutions. Iâ€™ve successfully delivered multiple implementations across industries like logistics, manufacturing, and healthcare in the US market.</p>

  <p>My core skills include SSRS reporting, customizations using X++, development of forms and data entities, and integrating Dynamics 365 with third-party systems. Iâ€™m also proficient in .NET technologies and have experience with C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, SQL Server, and Java.</p>

  <p>Recently, I developed this personal portfolio website to sharpen my front-end development skills and begin my journey into full-stack development. It represents both my curiosity to learn and my drive to expand beyond ERP systems.</p>

  <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy listening to music and exploring new tools that simplify business processes. Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me for collaboration or consultation!</p>
